## Setup AWS Environment

1. Go to AWS Management Console

9. Click the link above the checkmark for your application. This should open the application in your browser and display a Congratulations message.

### Change from Micro to Small instance type:

Note that a t2.small is outside of the free tier. t2 micro has been known to timeout and fail during the build process on the old platform. However, this may not be an issue on the new Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2 platform. So, these steps may no longer be necessary.

1. In the left sidebar under Docker-env click "Configuration"
2. Find "Capacity" and click "Edit"
3. Scroll down to find the "Instance Type" and change from t2.micro to t2.small
4. Click "Apply"
5. The message might say "No Data" or "Severe" in Health Overview before changing to "Ok"
